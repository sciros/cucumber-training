Feature: authentication
  As the Movietix product owner
  I want visitors to authenticate prior to purchasing tickets
  So that visitors have a personalized user experience and so that I can track visitor behavior

  Scenario: user goes directly to the login page and authenticates with valid credentials
     When I try to log in
      And I am logged in
     Then I am on the account page
     When I try to log out
     Then I am not logged in

  Scenario: user tries to authenticate with invalid credentials
    Given I try to log in with invalid credentials
     Then I am on the login page
      And I see an authentication error message
